2009-04-17	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Release as 0.3.3

2009-02-22	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* fso-abyss has been split into two subprojects:
	  - libgsm0710mux: the multiplexing engine
	  - fso-abyss: the (now legacy) dbus/pty server
	* fso-abyss will be kept update as a quick means to check
	  basic functionality, but the plan is to use libgsm0710mux
	  from ogsmd directly.

2009-02-20	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Added sending v24 data bytes on virtual channel from host -> module.
	* Changed dbus test command signature to 'ay' (array of bytes),
	  since test commands can embed null-bytes.

2009-02-20	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Support for wakeup threshold and waitms is now configurable as well.
	
	* Released as 0.3.1

2009-02-15	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Added support for a configuration file. The config file comes in handy
	  when you want the multiplexing session to be enabled when the first
	  channel gets requested. With the config file you can also specify
	  automatic closing the session on last channel release as well as
	  automatic exiting of the main program, when the session gets closed.

	* Released as 0.3.0

2009-02-09	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* The GSM 07.10 protocol engine has been split out and will be maintained
	  as a seperate project. That way we can collaborate on a solid core while
	  adding different frontends, such as a static one without dbus support, or
	  using the library directly without the pty indirection.

2009-02-08	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Add support for a wakeup threshold. Some modems (such as the TI Calypso)
	  do not use standardized PSC commands to handle power saving states. For
	  such modems, org.freesmartphone.GSM.MUX.SetWakeupThreshold( seconds, waitms )
	  can be used. Seconds defines the acceptable duration (idleness), before the
	  modem will be woken up, waitms defines the sleep period (in microseconds)
	  after sending the wakeup command.

2009-02-06	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Released as 0.2.0

2009-02-04	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* org.freesmartphone.GSM.MUX.OpenSession no longer returns a parameter,
	  if it fails, it will throw an error.

	* org.freesmartphone.GSM.MUX.AllocChannel now returns two parameters, one
	  for the allocated pty, the other one for the allocated channel (which is
	  unknown to the client if it calls AllocChannel with '0' as channel, since
	  this translates to 'the next free one'.)

2009-02-02	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Added preliminary dbus error messages and finished the dbus interface.
	* Successfully tested with a SIEMENS mc75i (07.10 basic mode)
	* Released as 0.1.0

2009-02-01	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* This project has a name now. It's called 'fso-abyss', which
	  is a reminiscent of the popular ILM movie 'Abyss' where
	  the beast was hidden in the deep blue ocean, but later turned
	  out to be friendly.
	* Reading and writing data from/to virtual channels works now.
	* Data gets nicely forwarded to our ptys.

2009-01-31	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Opening and closing virtual channels now works.

2009-01-30	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Initializing, closing, and reopening the MUX session now works.

2009-01-27	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Read/Write cycle from/to protocol engine works fine.
	* Contributed the first posix bits to Vala upstream.

2009-01-25	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Started the experiment to write a new GSM 07.10 multiplexer in Vala/C.
	* Committed the nicely encapsulated protocol engine from Qtopia and the
	  first bits of Vapi (Vala language binding).
