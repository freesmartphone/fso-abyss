Todo:
=====
 * Handle serial control
 * Add hook for channel ACK
 * Finish auto-reinit in protocol engine
 * Finish ping framework
 * Check PSC commands
 * Check SIEMENS version check extension
 * Use Serial object in multiplexer as well

Problems due to Vala:
=====================
 * No async dbus on server side
 * No proper dbus errors

Features of this Multiplexer:
=============================
 * Clean Architecture seperating
   - Protocol engine,
   - Serial port,
   - Virtual Channel,
   - Session handling, and
   - DBus Server.
 * No modem power nor init handling -- expects
   that this has been already setup for us.
 * Top priority is getting frames from the modem,
   so it doesn't need to wait for us.
 * No channel ACK race conditions, a pty will only be allocated
   if we get serial status packages from them muxer.
 * No pty overruns possible [as long as we have memory],
   channels will buffer everything in memory and deliver
   the chunks asynchronous.
 * Supports requesting individual channels in addition to
   the 'the next free one'. This is helpful since virtual
   channels keep state over opening/closing.
 * Ping framework (on modems that support it) for detecting
   stuck connections and transparent reinit.
 * AT-Command-based diagnostic interface
 * Workarounds for Modem-specific quirks
